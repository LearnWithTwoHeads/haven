- [hetzner-k3s](https://vitobotta.github.io/hetzner-k3s/) is awesome, you can create an HA Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner for very cheap
- The configuration file is relatively simple as well, with a lot of good documentation on the site, i've included a sample documentation [here](./kubernetes/self-hosted/cloud/hetzner/configuration/hetzner-k3s.yaml)
